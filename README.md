**Argument from Nature Fallacy**  
Logical fallacy occuring when someone argues that something is good because it is 'natural' and something else is bad because it is not 'natural'. The flaw with this line of thinking is the fact that whether something is 'natural' or 'unnatural' is completely irrelevant to whether or not it is good. Arsenic is natural. Cyanide is natural. Bubonic plague is natural.

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.


**Dunning-Kruger Effect**  
A cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.


**The Third Basic Law of Human Stupidity**

**Hype Cycle**  
A graphical representation of the life cycle stages a technology goes through from conception to maturity and widespread adoption.  

We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.  

Technology Trigger > Peak of Inflated Expectations > Trough of Disillusionment > Slope of Enlightenment > Plateau of Productivity


**Hanlon's Razor**  
Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.


**Occam's Razor**  
Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.  
The simplest explanation is almost always somebody screwed up.


**Innovator's Dilemma**  
Successful companies can put too much emphasis on customers' current needs, and fail to adopt new technology or business models that will meet customers' unstated or future needs.


**Prisoners' Dilemma**  
2 individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.  

Two prisoners stole $1 million and are being questioned. If neither snitches, they both walk and get $500k each. If one snitches, he walks and keeps the full $1 million. If both snitch, they get nothing.


**Loss Aversion**  
People's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.


**Throwing Good Money After Bad / Sunk Cost Fallacy**  
Justifying increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.


**Peter Principle**  
A concept in management theory formulated by Laurence J. Peter in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "managers rise to the level of their incompetence."  

In an organizational structure, assessing an employee's potential for a promotion is often based on their performance in the current job. This eventually results in their being promoted to their highest level of competence and potentially then to a role in which they are not competent, referred to as their "level of incompetence".  

Peter suggests that "In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties" and [the corollary] that "work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence."


**Ordering of Adjectives**
