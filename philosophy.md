## Philosophy


### Ethics / Moral Philosophy
A branch of philosophy that *"involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior"*. The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value, and thus comprises the branch of philosophy called **axiology**.

Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory.


### Meta-Ethics
The study of the nature, scope, and meaning of moral judgment. It is one of the three branches of ethics generally studied by philosophers, the others being normative ethics and applied ethics.

While normative ethics addresses such questions as *"What should I do?"*, evaluating specific practices and principles of action, meta-ethics addresses questions such as *"What is goodness?"* and *"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?"*, seeking to understand the assumptions underlying normative theories.


### Normative Ethics
The study of ethical behavior, and is the branch of philosophical ethics that investigates the questions that arise regarding how one ought to act, in a moral sense.

Normative ethics is distinct from meta-ethics in that the former examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, whereas the latter studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts. Likewise, normative ethics is distinct from applied ethics in that the former is more concerned with *"who ought one be"* rather than the ethics of a specific issue (e.g. if, or when, abortion is acceptable).


### Applied Ethics
Refers to the practical application of moral considerations. It is ethics with respect to real-world actions and their moral considerations in the areas of private and public life, the professions, health, technology, law, and leadership.


### Moral Relativism
The view that there is no absolute right or wrong and that moral judgments are true or false only relative to some particular standpoint (for instance, that of a culture or a historical period) and that no standpoint is uniquely privileged over all others. 


### Consequentialism
The doctrine that the morality of an action is to be judged solely by its consequences.


### Utilitarianism 
The doctrine that an action is right insofar as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be the guiding principle of conduct.

A family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals. Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations, the basic idea behind all of them is to in some sense maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being or related concepts. For instance, **Jeremy Bentham**, the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as *"that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness...[or] to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered."*


### Repugnant Conclusion
Compared with the existence of many people who would all have some very high quality of life, there is some much larger number of people whose existence would be better, even though these people would all have lives that were barely worth living.


### Non-Identity Problem
Arises when our actions in the present could change which people will exist in the future, for better or worse. Is it morally better to improve the lives of specific future people, as compared to changing which people exist for the better? Concerns a moral question about potential people who do not yet exist, but could exist in the future.


### Determinism
The doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Some philosophers have taken determinism to imply that individual human beings have no free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.


### Ontology
The philosophical study of being. More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular becoming, existence, reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.


### Epistemology
The theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.


### Teleology
The explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.


### Tautology
A statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form.


### Nihilism
The rejection of all religious, moral principles, and culturally accepted aspects of life. Existential Nihilism - argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral Nihilists assert that morality does not exist at all.


### Experience Machine
A thought experiment proposed by philosopher Robert Nozick in order to refute the philosophy of ethical hedonism. Hedonism suggests that the only thing that matters is human pleasure, and that the only goal should be to maximize pleasure. If hedonism is legit, said Nozick, then everyone would immediately elect to plug into the experience machine. But Nozick thinks most people wouldn’t do it, and to him, this proves that there are things humans value more than their own pleasure, and that pleasure for the sake of pleasure leaves us lacking something important.


### Doomsday Argument
A probabilistic argument that claims to predict the number of future members of the human species given an estimate of the total number of humans born so far. Simply put, it says that supposing that all humans are born in a random order, chances are that any one human is born roughly in the middle.

If Leslie's figure is used, then `60 billion` humans have been born so far, so it can be estimated that there is a `95%` chance that the total number of humans N will be less than `20 × 60 billion = 1.2 trillion`. Assuming that the world population stabilizes at `10 billion` and a life expectancy of `80 years`, it can be estimated that the remaining 1140 billion humans will be born in `9,120` years. Depending on the projection of world population in the forthcoming centuries, estimates may vary, but the main point of the argument is that it is unlikely that more than `1.2 trillion` humans will ever live.


### Lindy Effect
A theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time.


### Existential Risk
Any risk that has the potential to eliminate all of humanity or, at the very least, kill large swaths of the global population, leaving the survivors without sufficient means to rebuild society to current standards of living.

Some scholars have strongly favored reducing existential risk on the grounds that it greatly benefits future generations. **Derek Parfit** argues that extinction would be a great loss because our descendants could potentially survive for four billion years before the expansion of the Sun makes the Earth uninhabitable. **Nick Bostrom** argues that there is even greater potential in colonizing space. If future humans colonize space, they may be able to support a very large number of people on other planets, potentially lasting for trillions of years. Therefore, reducing existential risk by even a small amount would have a very significant impact on the expected number of people who will exist in the future.


### The Great Filter
The concept originates in **Robin Hanson**'s argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a **"Great Filter"** which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: human). This probability threshold, which could lie behind us (in our past) or in front of us (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction. The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.


### Dogma
In the broad sense is any belief held unquestioningly and with undefended certainty. It may be in the form of an official system of principles or doctrines of a religion, as well as the positions of a philosopher or of a philosophical school.

More generally, it is applied to some strong belief which its adherents are not willing to discuss rationally. This attitude is named as a dogmatic one, or as dogmatism; and is often used to refer to matters related to religion, but is not limited to theistic attitudes alone and is often used with respect to political or philosophical dogmas.


### Identity Politics
Type of tribalism prioritizing and highlighting concerns of a group based on racial, gender, religious, etc. identity without regard to broader interest.
